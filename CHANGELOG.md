### **(V.4.2.1 Changes) (1.19.2 Minecraft)**

#### Forced Rendering Mode:
Sorry, forgot to backport the full box rendering when Forced Rendering is on and Bounding Box is set to Full Block mode.


### **(V.4.2.0 Changes) (1.19.2 Minecraft)**

#### Bounding Box Mode:
Clicking backtick now has a Default mode and also applies to Barrier and Light blocks to go along with Structure Void.
 Default mode will go back to the block's original bounding box shapes/behaviors.
 NOTE: Barrier Block collision will remain active as a full block if connected to a server so you won't be able to pass through on servers. 

#### Non Replaceable Mode:
Clicking Page Up will make Structure Void and Light Block now let you place other blocks on them instead of replacing them.
